Tutorial 01: Basic Kafka Producer
==================================

This is the simplest possible Kafka producer. It demonstrates:
- How to connect to a Kafka broker
- How to send messages to a topic
- Basic producer configuration
- Delivery callbacks to confirm message delivery

Key Kafka Concepts:
-------------------
1. PRODUCER: A client that publishes (writes) records to Kafka topics
2. TOPIC: A category/feed name to which records are published (like a table in a database)
3. BOOTSTRAP.SERVERS: Initial list of Kafka brokers to connect to for cluster discovery
4. PRODUCE: The act of sending a message to Kafka
5. DELIVERY CALLBACK: A function called when Kafka confirms message receipt (or errors)
6. FLUSH: Ensures all buffered messages are sent before the producer closes

Message Format:
--------------
Each message contains:
- KEY: Used for partitioning (messages with same key go to same partition)
- VALUE: The actual message payload
- TOPIC: Where the message should be published

    Delivery callback: Called once for each message produced to indicate success or failure.

    Args:
        err: None if successful, otherwise a KafkaError
        msg: Message object containing metadata (topic, partition, offset)

    Kafka Concept - ACKNOWLEDGMENT (ACK):
        When a broker receives a message, it sends an acknowledgment back to the producer.
        This callback is invoked when that ack is received (or times out).
